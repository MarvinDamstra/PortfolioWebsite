## Summary

Pantheon is a multiplayer deathmatch map resulting from a collaboration between me as a level designer and a team of artists that worked on the visuals of the map.

The initial whitebox of the map was built as an introduction to Level Design. The visuals were created during a different term, where I functioned as design consultant. During a third and final term, the art was brought into Unreal Tournament Editor and the map was prepared for release.

## My responsibilities

As the Level Designer I was tasked with building a whitebox for Unreal Tournament. The map needed to be built around a theme: temples. In a second term I was given the opportunity to prepare the map for release.

### Development

*Coming Soon*

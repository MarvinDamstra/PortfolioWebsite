## Summary

SKYE is being created as an educational project over the course of an academic year. The goal of the project is to go through a different phase of development each term: concepting, pre-production, production and release. We are currently in the release phase of the project, with the release planned for June 19th.

The development team consists of 10 designers, 7 artists and a QA engineer. Additional development was outsourced to a team of concept artists and technical developers.
